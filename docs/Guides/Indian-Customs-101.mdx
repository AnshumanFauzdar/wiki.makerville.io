Customs and duties are a burden. They exist to encourage local manufacturing - but prevent just that when you are starting out.

This page documents good practices to follow when importing hardware components from abroad to India. If dealing with Indian Customs was an exact science - this article wouldn't exist.

1. Ask if the billable amount can be adjusted.
2. Importing from China will most likely mean your package is routed through some other country (Hong Kong, Netherland, and so on). Check if one of those countries already has what you need.
3. You can compare the duties based on the hsn of each component and challenge that, but it may lead to additional delays.
4. RF components are always a pain.
