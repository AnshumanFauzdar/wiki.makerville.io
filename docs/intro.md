# Introduction

On this page you will find information about the tech behind the wiki, how to contribute, and more.

## Tech

- The wiki is generated using Docusaurus - an opensource project from Facebook. The wiki source lies on GitHub, and it is then built and hosted by Cloudflare.
- If you want to build and run the wiki locally, you will require Node.js. Check out the [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/) for more details.
- The documentation is written in Markdown, but it supports some additional features as well. See [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for more details.

## Contributing 

- You will need a GitHub account to make contributions to the wiki.
- On any page, you will find a `Edit this page` button at the bottom - you can simply click on that page to propose new changes.
- Members of the community will then review those changes and merge them in the wiki.
- Creating a new page is similar - you can create a new file in the `docs` folder and create a pull request on the repo.
