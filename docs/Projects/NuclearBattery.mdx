title: Makerville Nuclear Battery
---

Despite the heavy name, the project aims to build a configurable, customizable battery project - including whatever firwmare is needed.

## Objectives

1. User configurable capacity (i.e. number and configuration of cells)
2. USB C PD standard for maximum compatibility
3. Start with USB C charging - add AC mains
4. Open source firmware - display, API for HomeAssistant
5. Current measurement on all ports
6. Made using open standards and tools (KiCad, Zephyr, FreeCAD)
7. Variants
   - Power bank
   - UPS
   - Field battery for timelapse cameras
8. API for HomeAssistant/Cloud control/AMC

## Applications

1. Power source for remotely deployed projects (manage battery information remotely)
2. Log data of your devices charging profile over time - create a db of such profiles (for example iPhone 11 with battery capacity 85% is best charged with this profile)
3. Kitchen appliances with USB C and battery are a thing
4.

- The above build works as expected. @anujdeshpande used it to charge his phone a couple of times. As advertised the current doesn't go above a 1A using the power boost PCB.
